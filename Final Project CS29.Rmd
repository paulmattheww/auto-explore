## Towards Automated Exploration

The primary goal of [`auto-explore`](https://github.com/paulmattheww/auto-explore) is to to establish and expand upon a codebase that greatly reduces the effort to produce a first-pass exploratory data analysis.

## Benefits Semi-automation of Data Analysis

- Faster time to insights & modeling
- Shorter exploratory data analysis turnaround
- Consistent, reliable processes that are vetted over time
- No need to re-configure old code to new situations
